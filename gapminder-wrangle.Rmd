#Here we go...

We've moved onto Chapter 6, where I'll be learning to wrangle data using dplyr. Tidyverse is already installed, but I'll need to reload because we restarted R:

```{r tidyverse}

library(tidyverse)
```

Lights on!

Now we're ready to read in the data, which is from GitHub. 

```{r ohidata}
gapminder <- readr("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/gapminder.csv")
```
