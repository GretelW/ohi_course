## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# ggplot Practice

I'm going to document the OHI course here, to get a little experience in writing R Markdowns as I work. First, we load tidyverse:
```{r tidyverse, echo=TRUE}

library(tidyverse)
```

Then we load in the dataset that we need. In this case it's a practice dataset about US National Parks.

```{r parks data}
#National Parks in California
ca <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/ca.csv") 

#Acadia National Park
acadia <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/acadia.csv")

#Southeast US National Parks
se <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/se.csv")

#2016 Visitation for all Pacific West National Parks
visit_16 <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/visit_16.csv")

#All Nationally designated sites in Massachusetts
mass <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/mass.csv")
```

Now we want to visualise the data - 

```{r header, echo = TRUE}
head(ca)
```

Now we start plotting. First, bind the plot to a dataframe:
```{r dataframe}
ggplot(data = ca)
```

Then add geoms - the graphical representation of the data itself

```{r geoms}
ggplot(data = ca) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = visitors))
```

Realistically though, this doesn't tell us much. The parks are all mish-mashed together because there's no difference in their data points. To remedy this, we add colour to the geom points based on park name.

```{r park names}
ggplot(data = ca)+
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = visitors, color = park_name))
```
 
 Now we want to polish the plot by adding details, like a title. We'll also improve the axis labels and the legend. 

```{r titles etc}
ggplot(data = ca) +
    geom_point(aes(x = year, y = visitors, color = park_name)) +
    labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Visitation",
       title = "California National Park Visitation") +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(legend.title=element_blank())
```

 
 Now I'm going to practice myself, with a slightly different dataset. First, bind the dataset to a dataframe so we can plot it:
 
```{r se data}
ggplot(data = se)
```

Next we'll add the datapoints and colour them to correspond with park name, and see what needs to be done after that:

```{r add datapoints}
ggplot(data = se)+
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = visitors, color = park_name))
```

Cool! It worked! But now, as instructed, we're actually going to make the colour represent state:

```{r change colour id}
ggplot(data = se)+
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = visitors, color = state))
```

We also want to add titles and change the theme:

```{r title & themes}
ggplot(data = se)+
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = visitors, color = state))+
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Visitation",
       title = "Annual Southeast National Park Visitation") +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(legend.title=element_blank())
```

Now we're going to learn Faceting, which allows us to split the plot into several plots based on data in the dataset. 
To do this, we can facet by a particular discrete variable:

```{r facet}
ggplot(data = se) +
    geom_point(aes(x = year, y = visitors)) +
    facet_wrap(~ state)
```

Then we can look at park name as a differential within state, like this:

```{r park name by state}

 ggplot(data = se) +
     geom_point(aes(x = year, y = visitors, color = park_name)) +
     facet_wrap(~ state, scales = "free")
```

There's lots more information, but I'm going to use it as a reference resource so I can move on to data wrangling through dplyr.
